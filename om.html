    <h1>Om Pingale</h1>
    <p>Student at IIM Rohtak | Sleeper by day, Dreamer by night (but still single)</p>
  </div>

  <!-- INTRO -->
  <section>
    <h2>Who is Om?</h2>
    <p>
      Om Pingale, the myth, the mystery, the mattress tester. A student at IIM Rohtak who is trying to survive the MBA life with the energy of a retired panda. Despite sleeping for 12 hours a day, he remains perpetually tired—unless there's even a whisper of a pretty call girl nearby, in which case he's magically alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Known for avoiding academic stress with clinical precision, Om claims he's “not worried” because of his family's hotel business, La Vi, which seems to be doing what he isn't—succeeding.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ACADEMICS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Academics & Competitions</h2>
    <p>
      Om has participated in multiple case competitions and surprisingly even won a few. But like most one-hit wonders, he peaked and disappeared into the comfort of his room shortly after. While others analyze balance sheets, Om balances sleep cycles with snack breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professors have stopped calling on him in class—not because he doesn’t know the answer, but because there’s a 70% chance he’s asleep or watching reels of labradors.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SOCIAL LIFE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Romantic Rumors</h2>
    <p>
      There’s a running joke on campus that Om could fall in love with anyone who talks to him twice. Yet despite being emotionally available for every single girl (and maybe animal), he hasn’t gathered the courage to propose to even the institute dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      His love life remains theoretical—much like his summer internship goals.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- FAMILY BUSINESS -->
  <section>
    <h2>La Vi: His Real Backup Plan</h2>
    <p>
      While his classmates grind for PPOs, Om relaxes knowing that the only P he cares about is “Pillow.” His parents run a successful hotel business, <strong>La Vi</strong>, and Om occasionally reminds himself that if all else fails (which is likely), he can return to managing towels and room service tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a world chasing LinkedIn stardom, Om stands tall (or lays flat) as the symbol of laid-back legacy luxury.
