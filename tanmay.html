  <!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
  <section>
    <h2>About Tanmay</h2>
    <p>
      Tanmay Waghmare is a B-school legend in the making—not because of academic brilliance, but because nobody has quite figured out how he got admitted to IIM Rohtak. His most consistent habit is hitting snooze on alarms and deadlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      He once submitted a presentation with slides still titled “Slide 1, Slide 2, Final Final.pptx”. Professors say he’s got “potential,” but only in the way a broken ceiling fan has potential if you throw it like a frisbee.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ACADEMIC SECTION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Academic Life</h2>
    <p>
      Tanmay is known for his "unique" academic strategies—like copying from classmates while giving them motivational lectures about originality. His favorite subject is lunch break, and his project contributions are so invisible that some doubt he exists at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In group assignments, he’s a silent observer. Not by strategy, but because he usually joins the meeting 30 minutes late and then says, “Sorry guys, I had network issues.”
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- RUMORS SECTION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Romantic Rumors</h2>
    <p>
      There’s a running joke on campus that Tanmay is in a situationship with Jahanvi Verma, another mysterious IIM student who has perfected the art of not attending classes but still acing participation marks. Together, they’ve been spotted at the library—allegedly studying, but mostly just Googling "how to leave group projects gracefully."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their relationship is said to be based on mutual confusion, shared excuses, and a deep emotional bond over missed deadlines.

  <!-- BATCHMATE SECTION -->

    <h2>Batchmate Spotlight: Om Pingale</h2>
    <p>Om is Tanmay’s spiritual twin—more sleep, fewer worries, and still confused about how college works. A man powered by hotel income and low ambition, Om’s journey deserves your attention too.</p>
