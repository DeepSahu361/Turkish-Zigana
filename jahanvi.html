  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section>
    <h2>About Jahanvi</h2>
    <p>
      Jahanvi Verma is the walking, talking LinkedIn post you never asked for. As a student at IIM Rohtak, she’s known for throwing around words like "synergy", "design thinking", and "impact"—none of which apply to her own work.
    </p>
    <p>
      She’s currently “working on something big” (read: a Canva resume). With a talent for appearing in every group photo and none of the group projects, she’s built a reputation based on aesthetics and audacity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CORPORATE VIBES -->
  <section>
    <h2>Work Experience*</h2>
    <p>
      *May or may not be real. From consulting simulations to internships where she changed the font in one slide, Jahanvi claims to have “transformed organizations.” If PowerPoint animations were a job, she'd be CEO.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her favorite words include: "disrupt", "personal brand", "CXO connect", and “let’s take this offline.”
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- RUMORS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Campus Talk: Tanmay Who?</h2>
    <p>
      Rumor has it, she’s emotionally entangled with Tanmay Waghmare. She denies it, but her search history says otherwise. They’re often spotted whispering at the library—though no one’s sure if it’s love or just an Excel formula exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to sources (read: hostel gossip), she’s rejected more proposals than Tanmay has submitted assignments.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- VISION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Future Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Jahanvi aspires to become a CXO, TEDx speaker, UN panelist, Shark Tank investor, and part-time motivational coach—by age 25. She's building a startup (in her head) that will “change the world,” just as soon as she figures out what it does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until then, she’ll continue to inspire absolutely no one—except herself.
